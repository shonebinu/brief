# Brief

Brief is a GTK app for [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr). It lets you view community maintained help pages for command-line tools.

## TODO

- Ctrl + F shortcut to focus on search input
- Update cache option that fetches the latest tldr pages and caches it.
- Integrate with GNOME Search . feasible? -> https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/tutorials/search-provider.html
